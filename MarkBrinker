                <h1>When Being Great Isn’t Enough Anymore</h1>
                <p>Your business is solid. Your clients love the work you do.<br>
                    You’ve earned your success the old-fashioned way: by being good at what you do.<br>
                    <b>But let’s be honest — the game has changed.</b><br>
                    Your digital presence hasn’t kept up. And in today’s world, that sends the wrong message.<br>
                    Your website looks dated. Your competitors look polished.<br>
                    And even though you’re better at what you do, <b>they</b> are getting the attention — simply because they appear more modern and trustworthy online.<br>
                    You’ve tried to fix it. Maybe you hired a kid, a freelancer, or even a “real” agency.<br>
                    And now you’re frustrated, behind schedule, and still not proud of what people see when they Google your business.<br>
                    <b>You don’t need another gimmick.</b><br>
                    You need answers in plain English — and a step-by-step plan that actually makes sense.</p>
